     * table created via Utils::createDefaultTableColumns() has a
     * created_by column, so this is safe to apply globally.
     *
     * created_by is no longer fillable at all (see child models) — it is
     * always stamped here from the authenticated user, once, at creation,
     * and can't be overridden by mass assignment or by a later update().
     * `status` is likewise no longer fillable; it keeps its DB column
     * default (see Utils::createDefaultTableColumns) and is only ever
     * changed by direct property assignment from trusted server-side code
     * (e.g. an explicit enable/disable action), never from request input.
